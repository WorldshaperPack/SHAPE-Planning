- General Pack Todo
	- Progression design
		 - Ore Miner ideas / concepts
			- Gregtech bedrock miners (problematic and buggy, would need to be rewritten to work well and doesn't really work out early game so you'd need another method for ores)
			- Custom machinery miners
				(Can be used on veins spawned as little structures or features similar to factoriores, but easier to accomplish probably)
			- Port of factoriores?? prolly not
			- Use of regular (non infinite/bedrock) digital miners for early game, with giant ore veins underground to keep them running a while, coal burner gens along with them having a low energy cost keeps this sustainable early
- Long term
	- [ ] figure out dimensional cannons
	- [ ] Interplanetary and or planetary mass drivers ?

- Cleaning/Textures
	- [ ] Polish and fix main menu, buttons
	- [ ] Recolor t5 rocket to etrium maybe (See how progression goes and if ad astra metals stay for primary rocket ingredients)
	- [ ] Make better icon
	- [ ] Replace stolen upgrade kit textures
	- [ ] Add missing lang (ad astra planets, custom machines)
	- [ ] Hide unused content (Unused GT machines/items)

- Mod Todos
	- Other Todo
		- [ ] Stack crafting table
			- A work station with either a UI to click on craftable items in searchable and scrollable, then click a craft button similar to NTM or gun mods crafters, OR by making something similar to a regular crafting table with support for crafting using stacked items, with JEI/EMI support to input (this is achievable by custom machinery without JEI/EMI support, JEI support on 1.21 but no EMI)
	-  Coremod Todo

	- WSGT (gt fork) Todo
		- Fix high tier multiblocks that have hardcoded voltages used (computation/fusion) (VERY low priority)
- [[Mineralogy because i can't decide]] hell:
	- #todo: dynamic function to tag appropriate minerals with ex. "primary iron mineral" for minerals that are majorly iron, etc
	- autogen crushing and screening recipes
